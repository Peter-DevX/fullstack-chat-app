# DevX ChatApp Documentation

## Overview

DevX ChatApp is a modern, full-stack chat application featuring real-time messaging, secure authentication, profile management, and a creative, responsive UI. Built with best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## Backend

- **Stack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), Socket.IO, Cloudinary
- **Authentication:**
  - JWT (HTTP-only cookies) for secure sessions
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
  - Auth middleware protects private routes
- **Profile Management:**
  - Users can upload profile images (stored on Cloudinary)
  - Only safe user fields (no password) are returned to the client
- **Messaging:**
  - Text and image messages stored in MongoDB
  - Real-time delivery using Socket.IO
  - Messages are only accessible to sender and receiver
- **Online Users:**
  - Online status tracked in-memory and broadcast to all clients
  - Socket.IO emits updates on connect/disconnect
- **Code Organization:**
  - Modular structure: controllers, models, routes, middleware, and utilities
  - Environment variables for sensitive config (DB, JWT, Cloudinary)
- **Error Handling:**
  - All endpoints use try/catch and return clear status codes/messages
  - Consistent error logging for debugging

## Frontend

- **Stack:** React, Zustand, React Router, Socket.IO Client, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Authentication:**
  - Signup, login, logout, and session check
  - Auth state managed globally with Zustand
  - Error and success feedback via react-hot-toast
- **Profile Management:**
  - Users can update their profile picture (uploads to backend/Cloudinary)
  - Profile images are always fetched from backend for consistency
- **Sidebar (Contacts):**
  - Displays all users except the current user
  - Real-time online/offline status with green dot and label
  - Toggle to show only online users
- **Chat UI:**
  - Animated, modern chat bubbles for text and images
  - Real-time message delivery and display
  - Skeleton loaders for sidebar and messages
  - Responsive design for all devices
- **Settings:**
  - Users can preview and select UI themes
  - Theme selection is persisted in localStorage
- **State Management:**
  - Zustand stores for auth, chat, and theme
  - Socket connection managed in auth store, re-established after login/signup
- **Error Handling:**
  - All API calls have error handling and user feedback
  - Defensive checks for undefined/null prevent runtime errors
- **UI/UX:**
  - Accessible, keyboard-friendly navigation
  - Consistent, modern design with Tailwind and DaisyUI

## Real-Time Features

- **Online/Offline Tracking:**
  - Backend maintains a map of online users and emits updates on every connect/disconnect
  - Frontend listens for updates and refreshes UI instantly
- **Message Delivery:**
  - When a message is sent, backend checks if receiver is online and emits the message directly
  - Frontend listens for 'newMessage' events to update chat in real time

---

## How It Works

1. **Authentication:**
   - On signup/login, backend authenticates user, sets JWT cookie, and returns safe user data
   - Frontend stores user in Zustand and connects to Socket.IO with user ID
2. **Profile Management:**
   - Users can update their profile picture, which is uploaded to Cloudinary and URL saved in MongoDB
   - Frontend always fetches the latest profile picture from backend
3. **Sidebar & Online Status:**
   - Sidebar fetches all users (except self) and displays their online status in real time
   - Users can filter to show only online contacts
4. **Chat:**
   - Selecting a user opens the chat container
   - Messages are fetched from backend and displayed with correct alignment and avatars
   - Sending a message updates backend and, if receiver is online, delivers it instantly via Socket.IO
5. **Settings & Themes:**
   - Users can preview and select themes, which are applied instantly and saved for future sessions

## Deployment

- **Backend:**
  - Requires `.env` file for MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and Cloudinary credentials
  - Start with `npm run dev` (uses nodemon for hot reload)
- **Frontend:**
  - Requires backend running and accessible at configured base URL
  - Start with `npm run dev` (Vite)

## Extending & Maintenance

- **Adding Features:**
  - Backend: Add new routes/controllers for new features
  - Frontend: Add new Zustand stores or React components
- **Security:**
  - Always validate and sanitize user input on both frontend and backend
  - Never expose sensitive data to the client
- **Performance:**
  - Use MongoDB indexes for large collections
  - Optimize image uploads and message queries as needed
- **Testing:**
  - Use Postman or similar tools for API testing
  - Use React Testing Library/Jest for frontend components

**Project complete. Built with best practices for security, UX, and maintainability.**
